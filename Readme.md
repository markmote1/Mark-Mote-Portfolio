This is my portfolio website which i decided to develop using plain html, css and javascript to showcase my mastery in:

1.  HTML which tells the browser how to layout different elements 
2. CSS which is for styling the different html elements.
3. Javascript which is a programming language which adds reactivity to my website, making the website responsive.

Errors-
I tried to deploy to vercel, after deployment it threw a 404 error.
